A fictional UK-Finnish company, Alikoti, develops eco-friendly smart home technologies. Since 1999 they have developed fully integrated Smart Home Solutions. Since 2011 they have begun selling standalone smart home devices, including smart lights and smart fridges, to be supported by third-party software. Last year the company made the decision to build its own Smart Home App. This is a Tkinter GUI prototype in Python. The prototype provides a graphical user interface that interacts with a smart home object. The smart home object is responsible for managing data for all smart devices. The company will use this prototype to make a business case for a fully developed application.

This project only uses the Tkinter library.
